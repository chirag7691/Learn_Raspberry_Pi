Step One: Updating the Kernel ==>


 *   The first step is to change where our Pi updates from, by editing a text file. We need to open up the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list as root, so type:
 *   sudo leafpad /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list
 *   Now change the line in this file so that it reads "deb http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/ wheezy main untested", then save and close the file.
 *   Next, do the following commands:
       apt-get update
       apt-get upgrade
