# Using Raspberry Pi GPIO library
# import the RPi.GPIO module:
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# To specify BCM numbers system you are using
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Set up the pin you are using ("18" is an example) as output.
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)

# Turn on the pin and see the LED light up.
GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)

# Turn off the pin to turn off the LED.
GPIO.output(18, GPIO.LOW)
